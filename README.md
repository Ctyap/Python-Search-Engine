# Python-Search-Engine
Built an inverted index out of provided HTML files related to UC Irvines web pages within its domain. Developed a search component where document retrieval was tested with queries based on tf-idf scoring. Integrated components together to develop a complete search engine. Tested a set of 20 queries that deleiverd accurate HTML files based on the calculated tf-idf scoring.

To use the search engine:
1. Create an inverted Index saved on your disk by running invertedIndexer.py. Change the saved_folder variable value to a saved path on your PC. Then enter the DEV folder path for the inverted index to be created.
2. After the inverted index was created successfully, run the SearchEngine module. 
3. It will prompt the user if he or she wants to search. Enter ‘y’ or ‘yes’.
4. Input the query you want to search for.
5. Relevant URLs to the users search query will appear in the console box after pressing ‘Enter’.
6. Input ‘q’ or ‘quit’ to exit the search.
